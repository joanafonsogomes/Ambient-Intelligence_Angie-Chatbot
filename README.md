# Angie Chatbot APP

## Chatbot that assesses the predominant emotion in the message with natural language processing support

This project consists of a chatbot with the ability to assess the predominant emotion in the received text and display it together with the message. The dialogue manager is responsible not only for transforming the message received into a response but also for maintaining the illusion that it is a conversation between two human beings.

**The analysis of feelings was performed with the aim of representing 3 emotional states: Positive, Neutral and Negative.**

The created character, **Angie**, gives life to the friend ready to help any user in the fight against loneliness and sadness, offering support and adequate solutions that improve the user's state of mind.
